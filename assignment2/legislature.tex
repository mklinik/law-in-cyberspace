\section{Advice For Legistlature}

We have defined 3D printing to consist of three different steps: creation, 
distribution and usage (printing) of 3D CAD files.
In this section we will look at these steps from the perspective of intellectual
 property law, privacy and personal data protection, with a focus on the 
 distribution step.

%// TODO: explain structure in rest of chapter.

\subsection{Analysis}

\paragraph{Copyright Law}
Firstly we will analyse how Dutch and European copyright law can apply to 3D CAD
 files.
Can a file itself be copyrighted, or only the object it represents or contains? 
This is comparable to intellectual property of artistic work and the technical 
measures to prevent their copying, such as DRM.
Finally one might wonder if a printed object might be copyrighted.

\paragraph{Copyright on files}
As sketched in the introductory section, whether or not intellectual property 
law applies on an object or file depends on the contents of that file.
A file in its purest form can be seen as a representation of a virtual object or
 idea.
A 3D CAD file is a specific virtual representation of an object, possibly 
encapsulating esthetical or patented functional ideas.

Without disproportionately difficult to implement technical measures, it can be 
very difficult to enforce copyright on files without regarding the content.
Such technical measures would certify said program to be related to some 
protected content without directly regarding the contents of a file.
An example of this is DRM, the failed attempt of the music industry to protect 
artists’ interests.
Failed, in the sense that imposed technical measures did not prevent replication
 and unlawful sharing.
A more interesting purpose for such technical measures is not to prevent 
copying, but to inform users that the file’s contents are copyright protected.

In no circumstances can a CAD file be considered software as it does not 
specifically instruct a machine how to operate and therefore Dutch and European 
software law does not apply.

This is similar to the argument that a 2D photograph cannot be considered 
software.
Even if 3D CAD files would be protected through software law, the ECJ ruled 
that 
\begin{quote}``The purchaser of a licence for a program is entitled, as a rule, to 
observe, study or test its functioning so as to determine the ideas and 
principles which underlie that program.'' [Case C-406/10]\end{quote}
The question then becomes whether these ideas and principles are protected.

\paragraph{Copyright on ideas}
This question extends to the domain of 3D printing files.
When considering intellectual property on 3D CAD files, legislation should only 
encompass ideas and underlying design principles.
Apart from serving a completely artistic purpose, such as a musical work, 3D 
printing often serves a more utilitarian goal as acquiring tools and simple 
spare components no longer requires specialist 3rd parties.
Currently, Dutch and European IP law excludes certain utilitarian objects from 
copyright.

If an innovative step is included in the design, Dutch patent law might be 
applicable instead.

\paragraph{Copyright on printed objects}
% TODO: I couldn’t find any legislation on what happens if an object that is printed is copyrighted.

\paragraph{Data protection and takedown notices}
As 3D printing is a new technology, not much case law exists on copyright 
takedown notices for unlawfully shared 3D CAD files and printed objects.
One of the first of such cases is based on a Digital Millenium Copyright Act 
(DMCA) takedown notice in the U.S.A.
%[Brian Rideout, Printing the Impossible Triangle: the Copyright Implications of Three- Dimensional Printing, 5 Journal of Business Entrepreneurship & Law, 2011-2012, p. 161- 177.]
Thingiverse, a network for sharing 3D CAD files, is one of the parties of 
concern in the case.
Supposably, one of Thingiverse's users copied original content of another user.
In the end Thingiverse removed the appointed files, even though the claimant
already withdrew the notice.

We have shown that at this moment private use of 3D CAD files is not unlawful.
The question of interest is how intellectual property law applies on 3D printing
 in such networks and how hosting networks and their users can continue to 
 safely share their ideas with the public as printing technology becomes more 
widespread.

\subsection{Expanding legislation}
Based on these grounds, several options exist for expanding legislation.

Copyright law
- Impose bounds on 3D printer market and usage of printers (*)
- Impose bounds on scanning of real-life objects

- Impose bounds on copyright of 3D CAD files 
- Impose bounds on distribution of 3D CAD files
	- Make sharing networks liable for actions and content posted by users (Kazaa case - See Milton’s summary) (*)
	- Make it possible for 3rd party authorities to monitor and control content posted by users and possible prosecute said users
- Loosen bounds on distribution of 3D CAD files

- Impose stricter bounds on copyright of 3D printed objects (Similar to copying of books)

- Should legislation make an exception for home copies?
