\begin{abstract}
This legal memorandum discusses the legal implications of 3D printing in view of
copyright, privacy and data protection.
We consider three different stages in 3D printing.
First there is the designer, creating a 3D blue print or 3D CAD file.
Secondly there is the distribution phase, where the blueprints are spread amongst user.
Lastly there is the usage phase where users print the actual object.
We regard the legal issues this new technology might bring forward from the perspective of copyright, and with a focus on the distribution phase we also look at 3D printing from the perspective of Privacy and Data Protection.
We close with a memorandum for courts, legislators and businesses in Europe and the Netherlands.
