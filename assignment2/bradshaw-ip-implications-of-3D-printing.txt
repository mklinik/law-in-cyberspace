Summary of the paper:

It examines legislation and case law in regard to 3D printing in 5 areas:
 - Copyright: unregistered right that protects artists and creative works
 - Design protection: exists in both registered and unregistered forms,
   protects the distinctive shape and appearance of items
 - Patents: registered right that protects novel and innovative products
 - Trade marks: serve to inform customers of the origin of goods
 - Passing off: English common law concept similar to trade marks

Their conclusion is that private 3D printer owners making items for personal
use are exempt from the vast majority of IP constraints, and commercial users
are less restricted than one might expect.

There are three principal ways to manufacture a physical object:
 - Subtractive: Cutting shapes out of a block of material
 - Additive: Adding material piecemeal to build shapes
 - Molding: Forming liquid or plastic material into shapes and harden them

These methods have been industrialized and automated, but the problem with
cutting is that the paths along which a machine must drive the cutter cannot
easily be calculated by a computer.  Only for the simplest of shapes.

3D-printing is an additive method, there are two principal methods:
 - A platform is lowered into a basin of special liquid and a laser hardens the
   liquid layer by layer
 - Fused-filament fabrication: molten plastic is extruded from a movable
   nozzle, building the object layer by layer

The main advantage of these two methods is that the machine's movement is not
restricted by the object being created. Above the currently printed layer there
is freedom to move in all directions.  This makes it easy to calculate movement
paths from blueprints.

What is the use of a 3D printer?

- Spare parts
- Craft and hobby items
- Educational use
- Unique requirements
- Fashion accessories

Intellectual Property Implications

Typical use case for a 3D printer:  manufacturer ACME, customer Bridget,
internet user Charlie.  ACME produces a range of goods, protected by various IP
rights such as trademarks, patents, etc.  Bridget owns some ACME goods, she
designs blueprints for spare or accessory parts for ACME goods, and uses a 3D
printer to print them out.  She shares the blueprints on the internet with
Charlie, who also prints and uses the parts.
