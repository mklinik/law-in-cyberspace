\section{Background Information}

The act of copying is fundamental to the human nature.  From the days where apes
mimicked each other in how to crack nuts open with a stone, to children learning
from their parents how to use cook, Gutenberg's movable types, Xerox's
photocopier, and computers, whose most prominent feature it is to copy
information from the internet to memory, to the hard drive and to the internet
again, we've come a long way.

Over the past decade, a new technology arose which enables mankind to copy not
only information, but physical objects.  In the forseeable future, private
persons will be able to own a machine, roughly as big and expensive as a
kitchen espresso machine, that allows them to fabricate plastic objects like
coat hooks, replacement parts for washing machines, and even firearms at the
press of a button.
