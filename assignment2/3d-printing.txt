What is 3D Printing?

A 3D Printer is a machine that, given a blueprint in form of a computer file,
produces a physical object according to the blueprint.

Let's call the person using a 3D printer the "user", and the person creating
blueprints the "designer".  If an existing physical object is involved, the
party that made the object will be called "manufacturer".

Designers can create blueprints in various ways, the most common are:
 - Using a 3D scanner to measure the spatial features of an existing object.
 - Using a blueprint design software to create blueprints by hand.

For the latter option, the designer can use an existing object as reference or
create a completely new blueprint without referring to any specific existing
object.

When there is an existing object involved, the manufacturer may not approve
with its reproduction, and the object may be protected by various intellectual
property laws.  Bradshaw et al (TODO ref) conclude that private use of 3D
printers is allowed by most IP laws in the UK, and because UK law is derived
from EU directives, similar exceptions should hold in other EU member states.

Now, as 3D printing gets more widespread and private use starts to impact
business models of manufacturers, they will most likely take action to reduce
these activities.  Just like in the past with sharing of music, a number of
different responses are to be expected.  Manufacturers might try to influence
legislation to strengthen IP law for example by removing or weakening
private-use clauses.  They might try to apply existing IP laws and file charges
against users of 3D printers.
